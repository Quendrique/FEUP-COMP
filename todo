global variables are being incorrectly stored - done kinda 
not sure of just how valid the symbol table is right now
arrays aren't being registered as such in the st - done
main areas to focus on for semantic analysis:
  check if variables aren't declared more than once
  in assigns, check if the variable type is respected (a boolean should only accepts 'true' or 'false', for example) 
  still in assigns, check if variable was previously declared
already checking for duplicate entries but only within same function or within global scope - fixed, but still need info on where the duplicates are
add line count ?? dont know

assign checking if variable exists in table but not if the correct type is being assigned
