global variables are being incorrectly stored - done kinda 
not sure of just how valid the symbol table is right now
arrays aren't being registered as such in the st - done
main areas to focus on for semantic analysis:
  check if variables aren't declared more than once - done ?
  in assigns, check if the variable type is respected (a boolean should only accepts 'true' or 'false', for example) - kinda done
  still in assigns, check if variable was previously declared - done ?
already checking for duplicate entries but only within same function or within global scope - fixed, but still need info on where the duplicates are
add line count ?? dont know

assign checking if variable exists in table but not if the correct type is being assigned
still need to allow for variables with the same identifier but different types to be declared

identifiers refering external classes (for example, ioPlus in FindMaximum.jmm) reporting an error, need to fix this (calls to static methods from other classes should be allowed i think)

remove getClasse().getSimpleName() calls and override the toString method of each node instead - done

variable = variable now type checked

variable = function call return type correctness now checked 

check if array was initialized with size before any assign

started checking if arguments in function call are of the correct type
